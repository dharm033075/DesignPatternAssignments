Q.1 java.lang.System#getSecurityManager() 
Ans 1 Singleton design pattern used. Here security manger object is not created directly(noWhere new 
securitymanager() used for creating object in System Class).By using getsecuritymanager() method security manager 
object created. And every where this single or only one object used as global.  These are the specification
of singleton design pattern. 

Q.2 java.text.NumberFormat#getInstance() 
Ans 2 Factory design pattern used. Here getinstance()  method is used for getting the number format object.
This method returns the different type of objects based on the locale parameter. This locale parameter is used in 
getinstance() method to get default locale number format based on the differ region. So It's giving the different 
number format objects based on the regions. This is similar behaviour to factory design pattern(providing an interface
to create object of similar super class type with varying input).

Q.3 java.lang.reflect.Proxy
Ans3. Similar to Proxy design Pattern. Proxy design pattern provide a proxy object to client so instead of using 
actual class, client uses the proxy object. Here first implementing the invocationHandler interface which create 
the proxy object of actual class. invocationhandler interface have simple only one method inovke, which take input 
proxy object to be proxied, Method which to be invoked and array of argument that method is taking as input.So by 
creating this proxy object of proxy class (proxy class can implement many interface)  client won't have any indication
of the actual class.
